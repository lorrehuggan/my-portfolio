I recently attended the Surreal DB meet up at Swingers Golf in the West End of London, and it was an experience like no other. The event was filled with pizza, cocktails, and a group of talented developers who were all eager to learn and share their knowledge.

SurrealDB, is a distributed, cloud-native graph database designed for high-performance and scalability. It's a relatively new player in the database market, having been first introduced in 2020, but it's already making waves for its innovative approach to managing complex graph data.

So what exactly is a graph database? Well, it's a type of database that's optimized for storing and querying data that has a lot of relationships between different entities. Think of a social network, for example, where each user has friends, followers, and posts that they've created. Storing and querying this kind of data can be very difficult with traditional relational databases, but it's much easier with a graph database.

One of the highlights of the evening was meeting the founders of Surreal DB, Tobie Morgan Hitchcock and Jaime Morgan Hitchcock. They were both friendly, open, and engaging, and it was clear that they were passionate about their product and the community that they had built around it.

I must also mention that I had the pleasure of meeting Surreal DB's Experiences Manager, Lizzie Holmes, at the event. Lizzie was a friendly and warm host who made everyone feel welcome and ensured that the evening ran smoothly.

As a developer myself, it was fascinating to learn more about Surreal DB and how it could be used to improve the performance and scalability of databases. I was particularly impressed with the platform's ability to handle large amounts of data and its seamless integration with other tools and technologies.

But the event was not just about the technology â€“ it was also an opportunity to meet and connect with other developers. I was able to chat with some really cool devs from different backgrounds and industries, and it was great to hear about their experiences and projects.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Surreal DB event without some fun and games, and Swingers Golf was the perfect venue for that. We were able to play a few rounds of mini golf while enjoying some delicious food and drinks. It was a great way to unwind after a busy day of coding and networking.

Overall, my experience at the Surreal DB meet up was fantastic. It was great to meet Tobie and Jaime Morgan Hitchcock and to learn more about their innovative platform. But most importantly, it was an opportunity to connect with other developers and to be part of a supportive and inspiring community. I can't wait for the next event!
