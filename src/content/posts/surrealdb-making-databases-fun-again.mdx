SurrealDB is the next-generation serverless database that simplifies your database and API stack. Say goodbye to scaling databases, servers, load balancers, and API endpoints. SurrealDB takes the hassle out of your stack, enabling you to grow and operate at scale with a highly-available, highly-scalable distributed platform.

And the best part? Getting started with SurrealDB is as easy as one command! That's right, no need to learn complicated database languages or fiddle with servers. SurrealDB simplifies everything for you, allowing you to focus on what matters most - processing your data.

But wait, there's more! SurrealDB is a multi-model database that enables you to use multiple techniques to store and model data without having to choose a method in advance. With the use of tables and advanced nested fields and arrays, SurrealDB is like a relational database on steroids. Plus, inter-document record links allow for simple and highly-performant related queries without the use of JOINs, eliminating the N+1 query problem.

Need more reasons to love SurrealDB? Well, how about the fact that it's built entirely in Rust, making it blazingly fast and memory-efficient? And thanks to its distributed cluster architecture, it's highly available and scalable, meaning you can easily add more nodes as your data grows.

To get a better sense of what SurrealDB can do, let's take a look at some code examples:

```sql
CREATE user SET
	age = <int> 35,
	name.first = "Lorre",
	name.last = "Huggan",
	name.full = <string> string::join(' ', name.first, name.last)
	friends = [user:Kendrick, user:Kodak],
;

SELECT *, friends.*.name.full AS friends FROM user;
```

~ In this example, we create a new user record and set its age, name, and friends. Then we select all users and fetch their friends' names. Simple, right?

But SurrealDB can handle more complex queries too:

```sql
LET $lorre = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE name.first = "Lorre");
SELECT *,
	<-like<-user AS friends,
	<-like<-user->purchase->product AS recommended
	FROM $alice
```

~ Here, we create a variable for Alice's user record, then select all users who like her and all products that her friends have purchased. The possibilities are endless.

And if you thought that was impressive, get this - SurrealDB keeps every client device in-sync with data modifications pushed in real-time to the clients, applications, end-user devices, and server-side libraries. This means you'll always have the most up-to-date data at your fingertips.

But SurrealDB isn't just powerful - it's also flexible. With support for SurrealQL, GraphQL (coming soon), CRUD support over REST, and JSON-RPC querying and modification over WebSockets, SurrealDB fits seamlessly into any tech stack. And with advanced table-based and row-based customizable access permissions, you can have granular control over who can access your data.

Recently, at the Rust Nation 2023 event, I had the pleasure of attending a talk by Tobie, the founder and CEO of SurrealDB. In his talk, Tobie shared insights into the development of SurrealDB from scratch, including the initial prototype in Golang and the decision to reimplement it entirely in Rust.

If you're interested in learning more about SurrealDB and the technology behind it, be sure to check out Rust Nation's video of Tobie's talk.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a database that's flexible, fast, and fun, SurrealDB is the way to go. It's the only database you'll ever need, and it's sure to make your data management experience surreal in the best possible way.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy
