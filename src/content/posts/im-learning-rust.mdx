After attending [Rust Nation 2023]('https://www.youtube.com/@rustnationuk'), I'm committing to learning Rust as a TypeScript developer! The event was such an incredible experience, and it convinced me that this is the right path for me to take.

I know that learning a new programming language can seem daunting, but after hearing about all the benefits of Rust, I'm more excited than ever for the challenge and the opportunities it will bring. As a TypeScript developer, I've mostly worked with front-end technologies and JavaScript-based frameworks, so I'm really looking forward to gaining a deeper understanding of lower-level programming concepts like memory management and system-level programming.

Not only that, but Rust has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially in the realm of systems programming and backend development. By learning Rust, I'll be better equipped to work on a wider range of projects and collaborate with a broader community of developers.

But most of all, I'm thrilled to learn Rust because it's such a fun and challenging language! As a developer, I always enjoy pushing myself to learn new things and take on new challenges, and Rust certainly fits the bill. I can't wait to dive in and discover all that this amazing language has to offer!

So let's raise a glass to a new year of learning and growing as developers, and to the exciting adventure ahead as I learn Rust! Cheers!
